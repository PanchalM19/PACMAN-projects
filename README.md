# PACMAN-projects

## Pacman-search
This repository contains code for implementing various search algorithms to help Pacman navigate through mazes and find paths to reach food pellets efficiently. The code covers fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence such as **Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and Astar Search**. It provides a hands-on experience in implementing search algorithms, experimenting with heuristics, and understanding their performance characteristics.

## Pacman-multiagentsearch
This repository is an extension of the "Pacman-search" repository. The above algorithms are extended to handle multiple agents, considering the adversarial nature of ghosts and implementing strategies for Pacman to outmaneuver them. This is done by implementing the **Reflex agent, Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, Expectimax, and Evaluation function**. The coded functions assist in decision-making against adversarial opponents, reinforcement learning for learning optimal policies, and probabilistic inference for handling uncertain environments.
